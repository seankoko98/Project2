#### by Sean Ko


### Overview
Dr. Masque and the COVID-91 Menace is a social justice adventure game will be on the topic of the importance of masking and the COVID-19 pandemic. As the player, you will guide Dr. Masque through the strange terrain of planet SKK-98 in order to rescue 4 mask shipments and save the colony from complete viral infestation. 

This repository includes the sketch.js source code, as well as utilizing the p5.2dadventure.js, p5.clickable.js, and p5.play.js files. The interactions and adventure states are outlined and managed through the adventureStates.csv, clickableLayout.csv, and interactionTable.csv files located in the data folder. Dr. Masque then takes these states and interactions and puts them into a playable code. The sketch.js file shows how all of the assets are loaded and animated, and how each specific mini game and interaction is linked to each respective state.
